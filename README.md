# GMPGS

## GUI for MAUD Plot Generating Script

### Description

This is GUI version of script for extracting Bragg's positions and Yobs/Ycalc/Ydiff from XRD output files of MAUD for ez further plotting using data analysis software like OriginPro/gnuplot etc.

### Installation

* Install Python 3

* Install pyqt5 using 'pip'

  ```
  pip install pyqt5
  ```

### Preparing

For generating plot we need 2 files:

* .par.lst file, automatically generated by MAUD if your analysis is saved
* .cif file with computed and experiment points of XRD data

Since .par.lst is automatically generated the only thing you need is saving .cif file. After refinement procedure in MAUD, open 'Graphic' -> 'Plot selected database' -> 'Tools' -> 'Export experimental\computed data' and save .cif file in current analysis directory

### Plot creating

Run gmpgs.py script:

```
python3 gmpgs.py
```

Click 'Add folder' and select your analysis directory. You can add multiple directories to batch analysis process.

Click 'Process' to run generating extracted data. After that in analysis directory will be 2 files - '...points.dat' with experimental and computed XRD data and '...peaks.dat' with Bragg's positions. Also script automatically generate *gnuplot* input file (in current version only on russian labels in KOI-8R encoding).
